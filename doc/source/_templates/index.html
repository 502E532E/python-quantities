  <p>
    Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and conversions of physical 
    quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality specified by various 
    units, and possibly an uncertainty. Quantities is based on the popular 
    numpy library. It is undergoing active development, and while the current 
    features and API are fairly stable, test coverage is far from complete and 
    the package is not ready for production use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like the quantities package itself, the documentation is being actively 
    developed.

  <p>
    Quantities is undergoing rapid development. The code can be found in a
    Bazaar repository at <a href="https://launchpad.net/python-quantities/">launchpad</a>. 
    A snapshot will be announced in January 2009.
